Q2:Describe the usage of the comma operator in JavaScript and provide an example.

Comma Operator (,) mainly evaluates its operands from left to right sequentially 
and returns the value of the rightmost operand. A comma operator is used as a 
separator for multiple expressions at a place that requires a single expression.
 When a comma operator is placed in an expression, it executes each expression 
and returns the rightmost expression.

Syntax:

Expression1, Expression2, Expression3, ...so on

Example:
 
function Func1() { 
    console.log('one'); 
    return 'one'; 
} 
function Func2() { 
    console.log('two'); 
    return 'two'; 
} 
function Func3() { 
    console.log('three'); 
    return 'three'; 
} 
  
// Three expressions are 
// given at one place 
let x = (Func1(), Func2(), Func3()); 
  
console.log(x);
