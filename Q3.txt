Q3: Use a nested ternary operator to check that a number is positive, negative or zero. 
You have to print “positive” if the number is positive and similarly for negative and 
zero also.

Example:

const num = 1;

const result = num < 0 ? 'negative': num > 0 ? 'positive' : 'zero';

console.log(result)

Output:

positive
